This week, I made a bit more progress on the research of traceable AI. I found it rewarding to learn through this research project that allows me meet with many expoerts in the field. It's an iterative process of self-learning, followed by structured conversations with experts in this field who have been pondering similar topics. AI is such a new and evolving field, but at the same time, it has also been developed for a while. New developments have led this field to be further explored at the intersection between AI and governance.

This weekend, I had some fun playing with Polis integration. It was an independent task that helped set up an interactive display in the Design Museum for an upcoming exhibition under curation. It wasn't that straightforward navigating through Polis's documentation, but in the end, I sort of figured it out. In between, there were a few moments I felt stuck, so I messaged a few friends who have experience in similar situations. I am glad it all worked out eventually.

This weekend, I also had a friendly call with Takeshi, joined by Erica. I am grateful for their time and enjoyed our updates very much. It seems like we are both preparing to embark on a new journey, and we both value some company along the way.
