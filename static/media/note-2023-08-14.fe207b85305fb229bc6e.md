DML has secured funding from MODA, signaling the approach of some challenging deadlines. I instantly feel the  pressure to deliver high-quality results. Recently, I've delved into projects centered around traceable generative AI—an entirely new realm of knowledge for me. I consider myself fortunate to have the opportunity to immerse myself in captivating topics within the field of AI. Apart from these demands, lots of other exciting opportunites have gradually unfurling before us, such as an upcoming showcase within a film at Sheffield Museums. Additionally, discussions are underway with a team seeking to curate an art festival for Tainan's 400-year celebration.

Internally in DML, the "civic-tech" team and porfolio are gradually taking shape, and I was quite lucky to be welcomed by a team of four lovely humans. We are in talks to establishing a task force dedicated to creating civic tech infrastructure across various DML projects.

To host the democratic input to AI, I also have been working tirelessly with the grant team, including my mate Alex, Flynn, Peter, Rowan and Carl. We recently welcomed one addition member – Nikki. This week, I took the task when we needed a webpage to house important links for easy sharing, so I spent some time over the weekend and set up an event page for vTaiwan's forthcoming opinion collection phase. It's really rewarding.
