It coming to the year end, so recently working tirelessly towards multiple deadlines. Hope to spend some time in Taiwan early next year and make some decisions on my next steps. Luckily, there are several opportunities that I am exploring so quite looking forward to have the last push in Dec, get the visa settled, and focus on shaping my passion work in Jan-Feb 2024.
