It was a recharging week. 

Some chats continued after the workshop in Oxford, and the universe kindly brought me to having a great exchange with Flynn Devine of [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). It was great to know someone who shares the same passion for adanving democracy through the lens of large-scale consensus building. This chat reminded me of the importance of designing not only innovative software but also building capcacity for particiaption.

This weekend holds three back-to-back meetings, mostly about rivers. We've been invited to tag along [g0vDA0](https://da0.g0v.tw/) for their hackathon session in [Ars Electronica](https://ars.electronica.art/festival/en/) in Austria this September. The [river chatbot project](https://shuyanglin.com/#/projects/river-chatbot) may be showcased under the theme of 'Who owns the truth?' and I am excited to scope out the project further with them. We also had a great introduction to the group advocating for Sulfur Creek (磺溪), who are eager to work with us and build a chatbot to voice for the stripe-necked turtles (斑龜) and white-breasted waterhens (白腹秧雞) in the ecosystem for a potentailly upcoming citizen assembly. 

I also met with [Saffron Huang, Co-Director of CIP](https://saffronhuang.com/), over lunch on Sunday. I was excited to hear about their next steps and how they are planning to use [Polis](https://pol.is/home) for the upcoming project for AI governace.
