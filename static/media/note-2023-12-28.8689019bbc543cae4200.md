Reaching the end of the year, I finally sat down for some planning. There are several discussions ongoing, and I have more clarity to my persue in 2024. There are a few people I am thinking to reach out soon and share thoughts, extend invatation for potentail collaboration. This year has been quite a year, marked by a move to London, a new job as a developer, the establishment of our own company and the overall enjoyment of all these important events. Looking ahead, we are heading to Japan in January for an off-site trip, and expecting more activities in the upcoming months.
