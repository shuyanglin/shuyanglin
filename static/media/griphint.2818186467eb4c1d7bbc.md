### Griphint

## Project Overview

It is estimated that more than 5% of the general population have symptoms associated with sensory integration difficulties and these estimates are higher for people with autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

This project focused on designing a product for children of high-functioning autism with sensory integration disorder to learn pen holding. Griphint is created as an interactive pen that provides instant light feedback according to gradation of force when a kid is holding it. With the right amount of holding force, they can write more sustainably without tiring their small muscle groups. The training of small muscle groups is important in children's learning and development because it's the key for them to use their hands, and develop other skills through touching and exploring the world around them.
