I spent a few days last week compiling the design deck for Interace for Care project. I learned a lot of new things while working on the slides, including positive rights vs negative rights, care ethics vs virtue ethics in normative ethics. As a result, we refined our objectives to transcend human-centric perspective through assitive intelligence to foster care bahaviours that facilitates >humans' active rights.

I presented the slides to our partners at Rivor Don on Thursday, especially Steve from Sheffield University and Alban + Johnny from Opus. It was quite rewarding to see how aligned they are with the overall direction we've been pursuing.

The work strand related to traceable AI was slightly delayed, so I will need to catch up on that this week.
