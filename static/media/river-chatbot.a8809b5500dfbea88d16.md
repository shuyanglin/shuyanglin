# Say Hi to the River
Conversational AI for non-human entities


## Introduction

Today's challenges are complex and involve various stakeholders. Solving these challenges requires input from diverse perspectives, but non-human entities are often overlooked and exploited.

Our project uses conversational AI to enable meaningful dialogues between humans and non-humans, creating an interface of/for care to practice reciprocal relationships, and empower a more inclusive and sustainable decision-making process. 

## Objective
"Say Hi to the River" aims to prototype a chatbot for communication between humans and non-human entities, specifically rivers. This will help build empathy and understanding, leading to more inclusive, relational and environmentally conscious democratic systems.

## Why Rivers?

Rivers have immense ecological, cultural, and historical significance, making them an ideal focus for our project. Not only are they a life-sustaining resource, but they also have deep connections to the identity, traditions, and values of many societies around the world.

Unfortunately, many rivers face a myriad of threats from human activities such as pollution, overexploitation, and habitat destruction. By focusing on rivers, our project can raise awareness of these pressing issues and advocate for the protection and preservation of these invaluable natural assets.

In addition, some legal systems have already begun to recognize the rights of rivers as legal entities, such as the Whanganui River in New Zealand and the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers in India. This progressive shift in legal and philosophical thinking provides a strong foundation for the project's goals and highlights the growing importance of recognizing rivers as stakeholders in our society.

## Envisioning a new form of Democracy

By facilitating human-non-human dialogues, we seek to demonstrate a new approach to democracy that recognizes and respects the rights, interests, voice and registration of all stakeholders, including the environment, marginalized communities, and future generations.

Furthermore, our project aims to inspire the development of ethical guidelines and best practices for designing conversational AI in a responsible and inclusive manner.

## Technical Implementation  

There are two parts in our implementation:

1. The brain: at its core, we will use the ChatGPT API to build our own chatbot that speaks for the river. We will use OpenAI Library as the LLM (Large LanguageModel) to train and create an AI chatbot. We will also train the model with river-related data we gathered from various river-related sources. For example, we could potentially use:
[LAWA (Land Air Water AOTEAROA)](https://www.lawa.org.nz/explore-data), 
[思源地圖](https://sourcingwater.lass-net.org), 
[National River Flow Archive (NRFA)](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/daily-flow-data). 
[UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology](https://eip.ceh.ac.uk/hydrology/water-resources/)
[Water quality data archive from UK's public data](https://environment.data.gov.uk/water-quality/view/landing)

2. The interface: we will build a simple chatbot interface, but also experiment with integrating with sound, audio, generative images variations. For example, we will potentially use Open [Frameworks](https://openframeworks.cc) to bridge multimedia outputs, and [Processing](https://openprocessing.org/) for generative images.

Our implementation will be open-sourced, and our work will be CC BY-NC-SA 4.0

## Design Considerations

**Ethical Representation:** Ensuring ethical and accurate representation of rivers in conversations with humans is paramount. To accomplish this, we must collaborate with experts in various fields, such as environmental scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists, in order to create an authentic representation of rivers that avoids biases and misinterpretations.

** Conversation Medium:**  We will explore various conversational interfaces, including text-based chats for simplicity and accessibility, voice-enabled interactions for a more natural conversational experience, and immersive AR/VR experiences for engaging and interactive dialogues. Our chatbot should be capable of learning and adapting to user inputs, ensuring the conversation remains engaging and relevant.

**Continuous Engagement:** To promote sustained human-non-human deliberation, we will consider implementing the chatbot in various settings, such as facilitated workshops, public installations, or as a component of ongoing democratic processes. This will encourage ongoing dialogue and foster long-lasting connections between humans and non-human entities.

**Privacy and Security:** Integrity and mutual respect are essential. We will implement robust safety measures and develop transparent data handling policies to build trust with conversation participants and adhere to applicable data protection regulations.


## Provocation Questions


- What are the key challenges rivers face today, and how can we guarantee that these concerns are authentically and effectively conveyed, leading to innovative solutions and a redefinition of democracy?

- How can we develop and apply ethical guidelines and standards for conversations with non-human entities while respecting their unique characteristics?

- What strategies can be employed to prevent human self-projection and addiction when interacting with such entities?

- How can we ensure the chatbot accurately and ethically represents water rights and associated responsibilities, leading to more sustainable and informed decisions?

- What methodologies and data sources are most effective for authentically incorporating non-human perspectives, such as rivers, into conversational AI?

By addressing these questions, "Say Hi to the River" aims to revolutionize our understanding of democracy and promote a more inclusive, sustainable, and empathetic decision-making process that goes beyond traditional human-centric boundaries.
