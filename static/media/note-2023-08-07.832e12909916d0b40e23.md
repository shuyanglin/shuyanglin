This week has flown by quickly. 

I spent most some time in the weekend and plotted a roadmap for DML projects and everything seems to be on track. That's great. RegardAs for the OpenAI grant, we're currently in the preparation phase for launching a Pol.is survey in Taiwan. It's taking more time than I had initially planned to come up with seed statements. The international track is closely watching and following our moves in Taiwan. It's crucial to keep our international partners informed and engaged, given their keen interest in mirroring the acivities ot international track. Immediate updates are essential.

Last Friday, I had an interview with Nesta by Peter Baeck, and Peter from vTaiwan also participated. This interview provided a valuable opportunity for us to step back, reflect, and realign our efforts, highly beneficial.

During the weekend, we visited our friends in Chiswick and stopped by the flower market. We got two medium-sized plant pots to repot the herbs we bought from the market just last month. Both the Thai basil and Shiso are thriving â€“ they've grown twice as tall, and we've already used them in several dishes.
