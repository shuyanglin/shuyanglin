The past month has been a constant stream of tasks, deadlines, and commitments. It felt like I was always running, but in the midst of the chaos, I'd like to take a deep breath and recognise the people around me who accompanied me along the face-paced journey.

Last month, I had the opportunity to return to Taiwan for hosting the vTaiwan consultation meeting. It was great to work closely with Erica, and through out this collaboration I felt more confident to start a duo studio with her. We then took a consultantcy role for Ministry of Health and Welfare and guided their way along organising internal hackathons along the theme of PETs (Privacy Enhancing Technologies). But, We saw the potential to create something more meaningful and innovative together, around the duo theme of food and democracy.

With DML (Dark matter Labs), we had a pop-up studio event in Berlin, I [presented the lastest updates](https://lu.ma/dm-civic-tech) around the river project: [Interface for Care](https://shuyanglin.com/#/projects/river-chatbot). It was well received, and also got lot more attention to co-create this work openly. What's so compelling about this use case and this kind of direction is that in thinking about rivers, it prompts a lot of open questions. There's a lot of tensions to work through, and that's the work. It's creating space for recognizing agents, empowering them to negotiate on their behalf and to reconcile with that inherent tension. A few of us in DML then participated [Beyond Culture](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/whats-on/beyond-cultures-of-ownership/) last Friday, co-organised with RxC and [Serpentine Arts Technology](https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/).

The work continues to involve and inspire. In the coming days, and I hope to spend some time distill these diverse streams of endeavors into a more in-depth, readable format that can be shared and serve as a source of learning for others.
