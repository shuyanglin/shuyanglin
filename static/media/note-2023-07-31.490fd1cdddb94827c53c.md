I had a few weeks without a laptop, which led up to a temporily silence in my weekly notes, but that didn't stop me from having some truly amazing weeks, packed with excitement and wonderful opportunities.

Firstly, I started a new job with Dark Matter Labs. Working closely with Fang on Radicle Civics, our focus is on creating pathways that encourage distributed agency and active participation. The work recognises that the world we are living in is an entangled or intricately interconnected economy, where value is interwoven and inseparable. Adding to that, we are fueling our efforts to producing prototypes that showcase our thesis and model real changes.  One of my key responsibilities involves crafting an interface that facilitate care for non-human entities in a world of self-owning agents. It's an exciting challenge that has allowed me to hone my content production skills while also diving into fund sourcing, partnership building, and overall roadmap planning. This month has been quite a milestone for me at DML as we recently sent out a bid proposal in mid-July. I'm feeling confident that our concept is strong, and now we eagerly await the results.

In addition to work, I also teamed up with vTaiwan and some incredieble new friends in London in the feild of AI and democracy. Together, we took a chance and submitted an application for a grant from OpenAI, which sought to bring democratic input to the forefront. And guess what? Our application was successful! We were among the top ten teams selected out of 800 applications, and we secured the grant! It's a humbling and joyous moment for all of us.

My calendar has quickly filled up with exciting projects. I couldn't be happier about the opportunities that lie ahead, keeping me busy and buzzing with enthusiasm until next May already!
