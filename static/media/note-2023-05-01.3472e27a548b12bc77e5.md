This week was a delightful mix of creating, learning, and socialising. 

I started off by tinkering with a chatbot that speaks for the River Don, which was surprisingly straightforward! I'm looking forward to using this as a jumping-off point for discussions with [The River Don Project](https://www.theriverdon.org/) next week, where we'll be exploring the legal personhood of the river.

I also had the pleasure of catching up with Liz Barry of [The Computational Democracy Project](https://compdemocracy.org/) who maintains [Pol.is](https://pol.is/home). We exchanged some ideas about how Pol.is can evolve into an ecosystem that provides software, methodology, and community support. It was also just wonderful to reconnect after all these years!

To round off the week, the bank holiday afforded me the opportunity to take a break from work and spend some refreshing time with both old friends (for a hike at The Hill Garden and Pergola) and new friends (over Chikashi sushi and takoyaki!).
