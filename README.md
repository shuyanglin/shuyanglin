## Getting Started

This project is created with create-react-app. It's intended to be run locally, on your computer, using Node.js and NPM.

Here are the terminal commands you'll need to run:

```bash
# Install dependencies:
npm install

# Run a development server:
npm run start
```

To create new components, you can use this helper script. It saves you a bit of time, creating all the files and adding the standard code:

```bash
# Create a new component:
npm run new-component [TheNewComponentName]
```
