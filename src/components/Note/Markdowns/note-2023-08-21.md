Since securing funding from MODA, we have initiated the planning of deliverables in alignment with the obtained funding. We dedicated time to refining the technical specifications in collaboration with akaSwap, our technology partner based in Taiwan. They will provide support for the demonstrator work intended for MODA. Also, wihtin DML, we've allocated resources for researching on web3 related policies and AI traceability. These will lead to generating recommendation reports which we will deliver the first draft by the end of September. 

This coming month seems to allow me more chance in gaining deeper knowledge in AI, especially in the traceablility part of generative AI.
