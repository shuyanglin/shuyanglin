It was my birthday week. I spent two days in East Sussex with Dark Matter Labs for their offsite gathering. DML members from all over the world gathered for the week, and I was lucky enough to find time to join them, even if only briefly. All the projects sounded very interesting and were driven by a talented group of people.

Afterwards, I celebrated my special days with my close friends and family, surrounded by the beauty of nature as I fulfilled my birthday wish of camping by the sea. We spent two nights at [a campsite in Kingsdown](https://www.kingsdowncamping.co.uk/), Kent, where we woke up every morning with a cup of hand-brewed coffee while watching the waves of the sea. It was calming. At night, we could see the lights of the stars and even France from the other side of the ocean. 

We also took a walk at the [White Cliffs of Dover](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/kent/the-white-cliffs-of-dover) and dined at [UpDown restaurant](https://updownfarmhouse.com). It was recommended by Erica's head chef. Their food was made with locally sourced ingredients, and the dining atmosphere was great as we were surrounded by historical features of an Grade II listed building which integrated in an open kitchen concept. We also made the most of our time there by exploring nearby cities beyond Dover, such as Sandwich, Deal, and Canterbury before coming back to London.
