It was a very fruitful week. 

I stayed at Wytham Abbey, Oxford for the weekend to attend a workshop for AI for Institutions organised by [CIP](https://cip.org/) and [CAIF](https://www.cooperativeai.com/foundation). The three main facilitators, Divya, Saffron and Lewis did a great job of bringing teams together to create exciting project briefs that will continue beyond the weekend. 

During our hack time, I had the previlege od learning about prompt engineering from Michiel Bakker of DeepMind. Through out the three days at Oxford, I had some great one-on-one chats with Aleks Berditchevskaia of Nesta and Aviv Ovadya of Hardvard Berkman Klein Center and Centre for the Governance of AI.

The outcome of the workshop will be compiled as a handbook and will be published at [ai4institutions.org](ai4institutions.org) around mid June, 2023.
I used some spare time to visit the nearby Wytham woods and was grateful for the experience to spend time among the brightest minds in AI and governance.
