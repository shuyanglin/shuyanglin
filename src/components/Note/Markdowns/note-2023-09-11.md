This week, I had a few interviews with AI experts. Jeniffer gave pretty good structure of the her understanding, and I like how she is able to see new topics from various angles. Shrey's call was very difficult but assuring. I'd like to explore meeting with experts in his network. David's call was joined by Theo, which helped greatly. Lots to study further, glad to have some surpports from Theo and Eunsoo.

Another track of progress this week was around the [rivercarehub](https://github.com/shuyanglin/rivercarehub) demonstrator. I found a few videos very easy to follow - and seems to be exactly what this project requires. I am using nextjs13 as the framework to connect to the chat interface, which is prompt by scripts stored in Sanity v3, which I found very useful. The plan is to spend next week figuring out the linkages across variosu systems, and patch these systems into one big platform before going into UX design. 

This weekend was [openhouse london](https://programme.openhouse.org.uk). We went visit many place and marked great memories. I especially enjoy the visit to an architect's studio where the host Santay shared her process of retrofiting a news house's hay (roof) level to a living space.
