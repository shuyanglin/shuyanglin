vTaiwan's mini-thon took place last Wednesday. I am grateful for all the online participants who took the time to join us. Peter was a great support, encouraging us and driving our determination to create a proposal. In the days following the event, we exchanged ideas every other day while he was participating in [FtO Jeju 2023](https://g0v.hackmd.io/@fto/book/%2F8xxkO_0ZQqm-ZeA7909V5g?type=book). I hope this can be a good opportunity to draw people back to vTaiwan and regain the momentum of our weekly mini-thons.

The work of DML has also begun. I feel fully empowered as I will be working on the Interface for Care project in Radicle Civics, with the support from Alex, Calvin and Fang which is both exciting and comes with a lot of responsibility. 

I also had a chance to catch up with Rimpei and Martina, whom I regarded as mentors in my previous work. They have always been a source of guidance and inspiration for me. It's nice to reconnect and care for each others.
