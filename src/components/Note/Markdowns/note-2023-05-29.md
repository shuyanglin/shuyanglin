Catching up with work after the holidays. 

Our conversation with Da0 continued. It was exciting to be part of the discussion with Da0 Taiwan about web3's most updated developments. I came across [Hypercerts](https://hypercerts.org/docs/whitepaper/whitepaper-intro) just recently so there's definetly much more to catchup on. Hypercerts is a new way of funding that rewards positive impact. With DML, we are in a stage of aligning our purposes and seeking collboration with our connection with Da0 Taiwan. Both communities are growing and I truely think we can together create something interesting.

Anticipating the amount of reading ahead of me, I borrowed a Remarkable e-reader from a friend living in Chiswick. I am debating between getting a Remarkable 2, a Kindle Scribe or sticking to my iPad Pro. Ideas are very welcome. 

After few weeks of treating my feet, I could finally get back to jogging. Plus, it is just lovely to be out under the May sunshine. A circle from my place to Primrose Hill closes at exact 3km, so that's a very good start.
