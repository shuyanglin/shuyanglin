I was writing my topic of interest for year 2024 and had a related discussion with a good group of people in DML this Tuesday and got some good critics about consensus. After having another discussion with a friend, I realised that the key moment I was exploring was actually "the moments when people change their mind" and, adding that the question of how/when people change their mind is also as important for understanding the requirements of the process - as what changes their mind.

My friend, Martin, shared: "I think a lot of processes are organised on the assumption that people change their mind very quickly, in the moment, or at the end of a long day discussion. While this can happen, often it is much slower - people go home and think about it. Maybe they agree to something on the day but it wasn't what they really think when outside of that environment a few weeks later. Or they stuck to a position out of pride, but later on the arguments that they heard against it stay with them and a few months later they may have changed their mind."
