This week, I had to shift my focus from my code editor to doing some writing and planning.

Following the AI for Institutions workshop I attended at Oxford a few weeks ago, where several project briefs were documented as one of the outcomes, I was encouraged to compiled a project document for the “river chatbot" idea. I like how their template largely follows the Heilmeier Catechism apporach so it actually helped me think through the project in a more structured manner. The document is titled “Conversational AI for Non-human Representation in Decision Making.” and is currently in draft stage. 

In the mid-week, I had a trial workshop online with researchers from Northumbria University in preparation for an upcoming workshop about Pol.is and ChatGPT at Newcastle. The workshop will involve public servants from the North of Tyne Combined Authority, so I received feedback to make it more hands-on and engaging by sharing real-world case studies. The other co-lecturer, Gavin Wood, who will be teaching ChatGPT, gave me some excellent advice on whether to use React or Python for making chatbots. This was particularly helpful as I'm currently on Module 3 of [Josh Comeaua's "The Joy of React"](https://www.joyofreact.com)!

The work with [RxC](http://radicalxchange.org/) to document the [Participation Officers Network](http://po.pdis.tw/) has gain momentum, especially after involving some PDIS colleagues this week. This was exciting because we discussed transferable knowledge and lessons learned from Taiwan that could benefit the rest of the world. I am looking forward to gathering feedback from Participation Officers down the line as well.

Another item on my to-do list was to catch up with [Pol.is](http://pol.is/) to gather a list of case studies where we used Pol.is in Taiwan. I hope that our expereince can be useful for Pol.is team and the community of facilitators who are using Pol.is at various stages of policy-making.
