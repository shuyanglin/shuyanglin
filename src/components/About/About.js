        Shu Yang Lin is a re:architect who is passionate about large-scale consensus finding. Through her work with Digital Minister Audrey Tang in the government of Taiwan, Shu creates interfaces that tangibly demonstrate the broad potential of human and AI interactions. As AI becomes increasingly prevalent in our lives, Shu has dedicated herself to surfacing important questions surrounding the representation of non-humans through conversational AI in the context of policy-making processes, in order to achieve optimal outcomes for the planet. By tangibly demonstrating the possibilities and limitations of human-AI cooperation, she hopes to inspire new ways of thinking about the intersection of technology and humanity.
